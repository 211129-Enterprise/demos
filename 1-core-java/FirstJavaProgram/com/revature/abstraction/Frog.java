/**
 * Java does not support multip[le inmheritance so
 * it can extend ONE class, (only one) but it can implement MANY interfaces)
 * 
 * Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only
 * essential information to the user.
 * 
 * This is achieved with interfaces and abstract classes in Java. You can't
 * instantiate either an abstract class OR an interface.
 * 
 * When we talk about abstract classes we are defining characteristics of an
 * object type; specifying what an object is.
 * 
 * When we talk about an interface and define capabilities that we promise to
 * provide, we are talking about establishing a contract about what the object
 * can do.
