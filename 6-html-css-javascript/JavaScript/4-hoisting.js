 * Creation Phase (STEP 1)
 * 
 * 1. Create the GLobal Object - web browser (window) -> Node = global object
 * 
 * 2. Bind "this" to the Global Object
 * 
 * 3. Setup a memory heap for storing variables and function references.
 * 
 * 4. store the function declarations in the memory heap and store variables within the global execution context
 * as undefined (declared but not initliazed)

 * Execution Phase (Step 2)

 * and executes the function calls.
