    <!-- HTML Images <img>
        
        Used to add an image to a web page.  It is a self-closing tag, so no need to provide a closing tag.
        Attributes of <img> (not all-inclusive)
            src     =   path to the image file (can be local or external)
            alt     =   provides a text description if the image does not load (also used with screen readers)
            title   =   used to provide titular info when the image is hovered over by the cursor
            width   =   specifies the desired width of the image
            height  =   specifies the desired height of the image
            align*   =   (DEPRECATED) used to align the image with any surrounding content (bad practice to use; use CSS instead)

            Strelitzia, whose common name is the bird of paradise flower, because of a resemblance of its flowers
            to birds-of-paradise (Paradisaea raggiana). The species S. nicolai is the largest in the genus, reaching
            10m tall, with stately white and blue flowers; the other species typically reach 2-3.5m tall, except
            S. caudata which is a tree of a typically smaller size than S. nicolai. The leaves are large, 30–200cm
            long and 10–80cm broad, similar to a banana leaf in appearance but with a longer petiole, and arranged
            strictly in two ranks to form a fan-like crown of evergreen foliage. The flowers are produced in a
            horizontal inflorescence emerging from a stout spathe.
