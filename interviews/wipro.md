# Wipro Interview Prep
*Below are the criteria upon which Wipro will evaluate:*

- Java 8 Basics
  - Basics/Fundamentals: Be confident and adept in all Java basics (Week 1 & 3)
  - :star: Collections: Maps, Set, `equals()` and `hashCode()` contracts
  - Multithreading: What are the multiple ways to create a thread in Java?

<br>

- Spring: *rarely evaluates on this in depth*

<br>

- REST API - What makes an API RESTful?

<br>

- SQL
  - Be able to make an `INNER JOIN` from two tables
  - Purpose of `UNION`
  - Purpose of Prepared Statements (be able to cite that SQL Injection is a recognized threat to Web services as stated by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection))

<br>

- Soft Skills: Evalutated for...
  -  Communication & Articulation
  -  Attitude
  -  Coachability/Adaptability
 
 <br>
 
 ## Coding Problems:
 *Below I've outline common tehcnical interview questions along with a resource on how to do it:*
 
 - Fibbonacci Implementation
    - [How to do it](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-ways-to-print-fibonacci-series-in-java/)
    - [Hackerrank Practice Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-fibonacci-numbers/problem)
 
 - Create a Binary Tree Insertion Method
    - [How to do it](https://www.baeldung.com/java-binary-tree) 
    - [Hackerrank Practice Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/binary-search-tree-insertion/problem)

- Evaluate JavaScript expressions such as: `console.log(1 + "2" + "2");`

- Wipro doesn't follow the normal panel style "question/answer". They will focus on Collections at some point for sure, however, they will test candidates on whatever they say in their "About me" at the beginning, especially if they say they are good at it.
    - For example, one candidate said he worked a lot with Maven. Eventually, he was asked to write a `pom.xml` file from scratch.
    - **DO NOT** talk about previous languages outside of these 10 weeks you've worked with briefly (like R or Python, for example), because they will turn the interview into an R or Python interview.  Stick to Java.
